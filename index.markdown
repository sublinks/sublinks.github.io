# About

Sublinks, crafted using Java Spring Boot, stands as a state-of-the-art link aggregation and microblogging platform, reminiscent yet advanced compared to Lemmy & Kbin.

It features a Lemmy compatible API, allowing for seamless integration and migration for existing Lemmy users.

Unique to Sublinks are its enhanced moderation tools, tailored to provide a safe and manageable online community space.

Embracing the fediverse, it supports the ActivityPub protocol, enabling interoperability with a wide range of social platforms.

Sublinks is not just a platform; it's a community-centric ecosystem, prioritizing user experience, content authenticity, and networked social interaction.
